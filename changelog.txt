2.2
- Renamed to Camera Boundaries Projector
- Fixed the fix... Oops :-/

2.1
- Fixed #4 by projecting in LateUpdate() so the projection will be adjusted when you move scene objects around

2.0 Major redesign!

- Now only does one GameViewSize per script. If you want more sizes, add more scripts.
- No Inspector Script anymore
- No need to create a collider and link to it. The projection will hit all colliders and only show the closest hits.
- Draw a tiny cube for each projected point.
- Projection quality: project any number of points, not just the corners of the field of view. Between 9 and 99 recommended.
- Draw Rays: You can draw a ray from each projected point towards the next. Nice for when there are more than one script on the same camera, i.e.: One with lines, one with rays.
- Added a few scenes to showcase the features
- You can now choose the color of the lines

1.0 Initial release
