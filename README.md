# Camera-Plane
Unity Editor Extension that adds gizmos to cameras

You know that resolution dropdown in the game view? The one with all the handy dandy resolutions of iPads, Android tablets, PS3 and X-Box? Wouldn't it be useful to show the camera's frustrum to all those settings without switching platform in the build window?
