# Camera-Plane
Script that adds gizmos to cameras in Unity

##Overview
This script projects the boundaries of the FOV of a camera and shows gizmos so you can see what is visible and what isn't. You can put many scripts on the same camera, each with a different aspect ratio so it is great for seeing what phones, tablets and different PC screen sizes will see.

##Features
Show the frustrum and see where it intersect on your colliders
